🌟 Welcome to the Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship Task 01! Let's embark on a journey of data exploration with the World Bank Group Analysis! 🌐📈

## Tools Utilized
- 🐍 Python
- 📔 Google Colab
- 📊 Matplotlib Library

## Task Overview
🎯 Objective: Analyze and visualize age and gender distribution in the population using Python and Matplotlib.

1. 📊 Import Matplotlib.
2. 📈 Analyze age distribution using provided data.
3. 📊 Create a bar chart for age distribution.
4. 🔍 Analyze gender distribution using provided data.
5. 📊 Generate a histogram for gender distribution.

## 🛠️ Setup and Usage
1. 🚀 Clone the repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/Siddhartha19Sinha/PRODIGY_DS_01
    ```
2. ▶️ Open the google colab notebook provided in the repository.
3. 👀 Run cells to execute Python code.
4. 📊 View visualizations for insights into global age and gender distributions.

## Inferences
📈 **Age Distribution Analysis (Bar Chart)**
- The bar chart visually represents the distribution of age groups in the world population.
- Analyze trends and identify significant age brackets.

📊 **Gender Distribution Analysis (Histogram)**
- The histogram illustrates the distribution of genders across the world population.
- Observe the frequency of each gender and draw insights into gender distribution patterns.

## Conclusion
This data science project provides a foundational understanding of age and gender distributions in the world population through visualizations created using Python and Matplotlib. Further analysis and exploration can reveal deeper demographic insights.
